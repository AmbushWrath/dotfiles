## <a id="Introduction"></a>Introduction
These are all the configuration files that I generally use to set-up my workspace. These contain all the vim files, tmux config, zsh config, snippets, spelling files, and alias files. So, basically my whole setup.

To make it simple, I have included some scripts that allow easy set-up of files. But anyways, the hard work it to be done first.

## <a id="What_to_do?"></a>What to do?

* Firstly, install the zsh shell and oh-my-zsh on the system.
* Then install tmux version > 2.5 ( cause it supports true color and I like true color :P ).
* Install latest vim.nox ( cause python support ) and setup vundle ( the vim plugin manager that I like ).
* Git clone this repo on your home directory ( required ).
* Run script Restore.sh inside this directory.
* Go to your home directory and open your .zshrc file.
* Change the line that contains the path and write your path instead ( you are only needed to change the directory name after home ).
* Open vim and install plugin using :PluginInstall command in vim ( you are required to do extra work for youcompleteme installation, open its git and help your self ).
* You are mostly done! Congrats!
