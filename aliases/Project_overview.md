## Last Project Overview

Last project that I worked on was a hybrid app written in Flask and Reactjs. It
took advantage of python jinja2 template from Flask framework. The app used
react embedded in Flask templates to handle complex user interaction. It was
mostly a menu driven process to create customer account. It required status
fetching for asynchronous tasks that were running in other micro services. It
also had dynamically created forms with variable fields.

I am also working on a hobby project, which is a dynamic profile creation
website. This is written purely in react. It uses a Flask backend server to
maintain data persistence. This website works with frontend routing using
react-router and Redux for state management. The goal of this project if to
allow user to configure a profile website with minimal input. User can create
new pages and define the content of those pages in Markdown.

I started react as a self leaning project to fulfil the requirement of the
project. I found it interesting and now I am following a online course on React
Redux which I will soon be completing.
