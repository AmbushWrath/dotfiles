# All I know about VIM( Vi IMproved )

bold in itself is a very interesting concept.
There are a lot of sources and tutorials that explain Vim much better than I ever can, but as I like writing and happen to be using Vim, I have decided to document things that I know about Vim.
This is just an effort to complement my weak memory and simultaneously help people to understand why I configured my Vim this particular way.

Moving on, firstly I want to straight away remember all the external softwares that I am using besides vim.
I am using Vim-nox(8.\*) as it has python support and I need that.
Secondly I use Tmux and Tmuxinator to create and maintian my working environment. I haven't gone too deep into Tmux and just use what's essential for my work flow. This includes Vimux. Cause I do Python coding, anyways, Vimux is always handy.
